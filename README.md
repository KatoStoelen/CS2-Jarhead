Forked from [Dentosal](https://github.com/Dentosal/python-sc2-bot-template)

Used by [sc2-bot-match-runner](https://gitlab.com/geek-retreat/sc2-bot-match-runner)

## Setup

You'll need Python 3.6 or newer.

1. Change the name and race of your bot from `botinfo.json`
2. Install the SC2 Python API: `pip3 install --user --upgrade sc2`.
3. Try it: `python3 run_locally.py`
4. Start coding!

Starting points:

- [Python SC2 API docs](https://github.com/Dentosal/python-sc2), check out the Wiki!
- Your bot code goes to `bot/main.py`
- You can modify the `run_locally.py` starter script to your liking
- Do not modify `start_bot.py` which is used by the competition runner scripts
